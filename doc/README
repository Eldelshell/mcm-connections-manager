MCM Connections Manager (mcm)

Description: Manage connections to servers from the console or GNOME
 MCM Connections Manager allows you to manage your list of
 servers you usually connect to. Provided is a terminal version and
 a GNOME version which is a very complete terminal emulator like
 gnome-terminal with the additions of ease to connect to ssh, vnc,
 rdp, ftp and telnet servers. Also, mcm-gtk provides the optional
 usage of cluster commands. With this you can connect to many servers
 and issue commands on all of them.

This software is designed to ease the management of connections to several
types of servers. Since I couldn't find any solution to handle all types of
connections from a console, mcm was born.
The idea is to avoid having to maintain a separate spreadsheet or wiki page
with all the servers I usually connect to and keep that monster open during
my work sessions.
There are other solutions, but each handled either ssh only connections, or
graphical connections (like vnc). Also, this graphical connections managers
were designed to have a GUI and a single command from the console is what I
wanted.
My main objective is to provide a fast and reliable mean to store the
information of this connections and be able to reach them fast and easily.

As of this version, mcm works with the following protocols:
-ssh
-vnc
-rdp (windows)
-telnet
-ftp
