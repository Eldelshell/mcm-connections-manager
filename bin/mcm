# Introduction
#
# The MCM Connection Manager is created to ease the management of connections to different
# servers a sysadmin usually connects to. I'm aiming to provide support for:
# -ssh
# -telnet
# -vnc
# -rdesktop
# -ftp
#
# This basically depends on which of this programs can be called from the command line without
# too much trouble. Also, very basic options will be used, so if you want more complex options
# like mount usb drives for rdesktop, or sound for VNC, use the proper utilities for this or
# modify mcm.
